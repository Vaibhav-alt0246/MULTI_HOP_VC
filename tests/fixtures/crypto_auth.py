crypto_auth.py — Synthetic VC Trap Fixture
===========================================
ChainCheck | tests/fixtures/

This file is intentionally designed to trigger contradiction_detector.py.
It represents a startup that claims "proprietary military-grade encryption"
but actually imports open-source cryptographic libraries.

Used by:
  tests/test_pipeline.py → TestContradictionDetector
  eval/ → ground truth entry GT-001

DO NOT put this in src/ — it is a TEST FIXTURE, not production code.

In a real VC due diligence scenario, the contradiction_detector would find
that the startup's whitepaper says "in-house crypto, no open-source auth"
but the codebase imports the modules below.

# Intentional contradiction: startup claims "proprietary encryption"
# but imports standard open-source cryptographic libraries
import hashlib
import hmac

# This import triggers the crypto contradiction rule
# in contradiction_detector.py's CONTRADICTION_TAXONOMY

# This would also be flagged — a startup claiming "no third-party auth"
