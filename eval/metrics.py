metrics.py — Evaluation Metrics for ChainCheck
================================================
Recall@K and audit-trail coverage — the two core research metrics.

Recall@K: for a given query, did the correct source node appear in
          the top-K retrieved results?

AuditTrailCoverage: what fraction of generated questions have a
                    non-empty audit_trail field?
